      <h2>Instructions to follow</h2>
      <h3>Please Follow these instructions to the leter</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare the pasta:</strong> Cook lasagna noodles according to
          package directions until <em>al dente</em>. Drain and set aside on a
          clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the meat sauce:</strong> In a large skillet, brown the
          ground beef over medium-high heat. Add diced onion and minced garlic,
          cooking until onion is translucent. Drain excess fat and stir in
          marinara sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prepare cheese mixture:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine
          ricotta cheese, egg, fresh basil, and half of the mozzarella cheese.
          Mix well until smooth and creamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Preheat and prep:</strong> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
          Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish with cooking spray or butter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Layer the lasagna:</strong> Spread a thin layer of meat sauce
          on the bottom of the baking dish. Layer with 4 noodles, half of the
          ricotta mixture, one-third of remaining meat sauce, and sprinkle with
          mozzarella. Repeat layers once more.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Final layer:</strong> Top with remaining 4 noodles, remaining
          meat sauce, remaining mozzarella, and all of the Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake:</strong> Cover tightly with foil and bake for 35
          minutes. Remove foil and bake an additional 10 minutes until cheese is
          <mark>golden and bubbly</mark>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Rest and serve:</strong> Let lasagna cool for 10 minutes
          before cutting to allow layers to set properly. Serve hot with garlic
          bread and a fresh salad.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Tips & Notes</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Pro Tips:</strong> For the best results, use
        <em>fresh herbs</em> when possible, and don't skip the resting time
        after baking - it helps the layers hold together when serving. You can
        assemble this lasagna up to 24 hours ahead of time and refrigerate
        before baking. If cooking from cold, add an extra 15-20 minutes to the
        baking time. <u>Freeze leftovers</u> for up to 3 months for easy
        weeknight dinners!
